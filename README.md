## Gentoo/Linux Configuration
This is my Gentoo Linux backup configuration. I'm not going to explain, but you can use it.

My Portage's profile is **default/linux/amd64/17.1 (stable)**

## Config Kernel T440P Linux
I have a configuration kernel file for the Thinkpad T440P without bloated stuff (better than generic). It takes 30â€“50 minutes to compile, depending on your setting. Feel free to use.

It's important to know that is the kernel used for Xanmod with TT. Please run `make oldconfig` and adjust some settings.
